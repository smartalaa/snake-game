## 💡 Key Technical Highlights

### State Management Flow
```
User Input → Event → BLoC → State → UI Update
                ↓
           Repository
                ↓
        Service/Storage
```

### Game Loop
```
Timer.periodic(speed) →
  UpdateFrameEvent →
    Calculate new head position →
      Check collisions →
        If food: Grow & Score →
          Check achievements →
            Update state →
              UI rebuilds
```

### Maze System
```
MazeType enum → MazeFactory.create() →
  Generate walls (Set<Position>) →
    Collision detection uses walls →
      Render walls on canvas
```
